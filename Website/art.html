<h1>Why does this Website Exist?</h1>
<h2>This is probably going to be the most professional part of the website [ew]</h2>
<p>basically this website was only made as a joke but now i guess, its more a joke because I'm tooooo much of time making this special website (special neeeeeeedssss) and i probably
should start hanging out with people and actually start socialize with people. omg is this a mental breakdown?
I'm having Existential crisis? Omg this what amine does to me, CURSE YOU SPIDER RIDER!</p>

<p>Okay so the person writing this had a starbucks breakdown so I'm going to be writing the rest. This website its just a big shit show that happen in one of the best class, Business class. Omg I'm having
flashbacks to bean. *screams in EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*</p>
